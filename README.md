# ConvertShift

ConvertShift is a privacy-focused file conversion platform that lets you transform files right in your browser - no uploads, no servers, just seamless local processing.

## Why ConvertShift?

Have you ever needed to:
- Compress a profile picture to meet GitHub's 1MB limit?
- Convert an iPhone video to MP4 for sharing?
- Resize images in bulk for your website?

I built ConvertShift because I was tired of bouncing between sketchy file conversion websites, never knowing where my files were being uploaded or what was happening to them. I figured others probably face these same frustrations too.

## Key Features

- **Image Compression** - Compress images to a target size while maintaining quality
- **Multiple Format Support** - Handle PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, SVG and more
- **Batch Processing** - Convert up to 1000 files at once
- **Complete Privacy** - All processing happens locally in your browser
- **No Limitations** - No file size limits, no ads, no signups

## Privacy First

Your files never leave your device. ConvertShift processes everything locally in your browser - no server uploads, no data collection, no compromises on privacy.
